CasperJS documentation
======================

CasperJS is an open source **navigation scripting & testing utility**
written in Javascript and based on
`PhantomJS <http://www.phantomjs.org/>`_ â€” the scriptable headless
`WebKit <http://www.webkit.org/>`_ engine. It eases the process of
**defining a full navigation scenario** and provides useful **high-level
functions, methods & syntactic sugar** for doing common tasks such as:

-  defining & ordering browsing navigation steps
-  filling & submitting forms
-  clicking & following links
-  capturing screenshots of a page (or part of it)
-  making assertions on remote DOM
-  logging events
-  downloading resources, including binary ones
-  writing functional test suites, saving results as JUnit XML
-  scraping Web contents
